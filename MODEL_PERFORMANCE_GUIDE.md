# üß™ ASL Model Performance & Training Data Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the improvements made to background removal and the new model performance evaluation tools to help you understand and improve your ASL recognition system.

## üîß Background Removal Improvements

### Enhanced Multi-Colorspace Detection
The background removal has been significantly improved with:

1. **Four Color Spaces**: BGR, HSV, YCrCb, and LAB for robust skin detection
2. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Handles lighting variations automatically
3. **Connected Components**: Selects the largest hand region
4. **Advanced Morphology**: Better edge refinement and noise removal

### Key Improvements:
- **LAB Color Space**: Added for consistent lighting conditions
- **Adaptive Threshold**: Finds hand boundaries automatically
- **Largest Component Selection**: Eliminates background noise
- **Enhanced Kernels**: Larger morphological operations for better results

## üìä Model Performance Evaluation (Press 'M' in Live System)

### What It Shows:
1. **Input Comparison**: Original vs Background Removed vs Model Input
2. **Confidence Analysis**: Full prediction probabilities for all classes
3. **Consistency Check**: Runs 5 predictions to check stability
4. **Training Compatibility**: Analyzes how well your live data matches training data
5. **Quality Metrics**: Background percentage, skin detection, color variance
6. **Specific Recommendations**: Actionable steps to improve performance

### Key Metrics:
- **Background Match**: Should be >70% black for best performance
- **Consistency Score**: Should be >60% for reliable predictions
- **Quality Score**: Combined metric of all factors
- **Training Compatibility**: How well your live data matches training expectations

## üéØ Critical Issue: Training vs Live Data Mismatch

### The Problem:
Your model was trained on images with **black backgrounds**, but your live system was feeding **images with backgrounds** to the model. This creates a domain gap that severely impacts performance.

### The Solution:
1. **Background Removal Integration**: Now applied before model prediction
2. **Consistent Pipeline**: Live system uses same preprocessing as training should
3. **Quality Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of background removal effectiveness

## üì∏ Collecting Better Training Data

### New Live Training Data Collector (`collect_live_training_data.py`)

This script uses the **exact same pipeline** as your live ASL system to collect training data:

```bash
python collect_live_training_data.py
```

**Controls:**
- `A`, `B`, `C`: Capture sign for that letter
- `SPACE`: Preview background removal
- `R`: Reset background learning  
- `Q`: Quit

### Features:
- **Same Background Removal**: Uses identical pipeline as live system
- **Quality Assessment**: Shows quality score for each sample
- **Automatic Saving**: Saves both original and processed versions
- **Metadata Tracking**: Complete pipeline information for each sample
- **Real-time Preview**: See exactly what the model will see

## üìà Performance Analysis Workflow

### 1. Run Live System
```bash
python run_live_asl.py
```

### 2. Test Model Performance
- Press `M` during live recognition to run comprehensive evaluation
- Look for:
  - **Background Match**: >70% black pixels
  - **Consistency**: >60% same predictions
  - **Confidence**: Above your threshold

### 3. Collect Better Training Data (if needed)
```bash
python collect_live_training_data.py
```
- Collect 50-100+ samples per class in your actual environment
- Ensure quality scores >60 for best training data

### 4. Retrain Model (if needed)
If your live environment differs significantly from training data:
```bash
# Use your existing training pipeline with new live data
python -m src.asl_dl.scripts.train_abc --data_dir data/raw/live_training_data
```

## üé™ Live System Controls

### Enhanced Controls:
- `Q`: Quit
- `S`: Toggle statistics
- `R`: Reset hand tracker
- `B`: Reset background learning
- `SPACE`: Pause/unpause
- `C`: üì∏ Capture detailed analysis (14 panels)
- `P`: Toggle performance mode
- `+/-`: Adjust frame skip rate
- `M`: üß™ **Model performance evaluation**

## üîç Understanding the Results

### Good Performance Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Background removal: >70% black pixels
- ‚úÖ Consistency score: >60%
- ‚úÖ Model confidence: Above threshold
- ‚úÖ Quality score: >60

### Warning Signs:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Background removal: <50% black pixels
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consistency score: <60%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High color variance: >40
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Low confidence: Below threshold

### Action Items:
- **Poor Background Removal**: Improve lighting, adjust hand position
- **Low Consistency**: Check data quality, consider retraining
- **Training Mismatch**: Collect live environment training data
- **Lighting Issues**: Use more consistent lighting setup

## üöÄ Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Assess Current Performance
1. Run live system with existing model
2. Press `M` to evaluate performance
3. Check background removal quality
4. Note consistency and confidence scores

### Phase 2: Improve Background Removal
1. Adjust lighting for better skin detection
2. Use consistent hand positions
3. Ensure clean background for better MOG2 learning

### Phase 3: Collect Live Training Data (if needed)
1. Use `collect_live_training_data.py`
2. Collect 50+ samples per class in your environment
3. Ensure quality scores >60
4. Focus on conditions where live system will be used

### Phase 4: Retrain (if needed)
1. Use collected live data for retraining
2. Mix with original training data if needed
3. Validate with live system performance evaluation
