## 🛠️ Test Development Guidelines

### Writing Unit Tests
1. **Isolation**: Test individual functions/classes in isolation
2. **Coverage**: Test both happy path and edge cases
3. **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings explaining what and why

Example:
```python
def test_function_name(self, fixture):
    """
    TEST: What does this test verify?
    
    WHY: Why is this test important?
    
    CHECKS: What specific things are checked?
    """
    # Test implementation
    assert expected_behavior
```

### Writing Integration Tests
1. **Real Components**: Use actual components, minimal mocking
2. **Workflows**: Test complete workflows between modules
3. **Error Handling**: Test failure scenarios across boundaries
4. **Performance**: Basic performance checks

### Writing System Tests
1. **End-to-End**: Test complete user workflows
2. **Environment**: Test in realistic conditions
3. **Performance**: Actual performance benchmarks
4. **Stability**: Long-running stability tests

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Environment Setup
Tests automatically handle Python path setup and imports. Each test file includes:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add src to path for imports
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent.parent / "src"))
```

### Fixtures
Common fixtures are available for:
- Mock camera frames
- Sample hand detections
- Temporary directories
- Model instances

### Continuous Integration
The test suite is designed for CI/CD with:
- Clear pass/fail indicators
- Detailed error reporting
- Performance metrics
- Coverage reporting
